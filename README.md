## Overview  
  This goal of this solo project was to provide practice learning new skills and sharpening old ones with writing HTML & CSS. The expectation was to build a static page that maintained the integrity of a provided comp. Each student was allowed creative freedom with the copy, images, icons, fonts, and colors. I chose to create a grain shopping and resource page as I had images and knowledge from previous work experiences.

## Project Goals  
  The learning goals of this project were to:  
  - write organized and dry HTML & CSS.
  - learn to use the 'grid' layout.
  - make a responsive site.    

## Project Spec  
  You can find the project rubric [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/static-comp-challenge.html).  

## Technologies  
  Technologies used were: CSS and HTML.  

## Code Architecture  
  This application consists of one HTML file (index.html), one CSS file (styles.css), and an assets folder (containing icons and images). The HTML provides the structure of the site and the CSS provides the styling of this structure. The images are personal property and the icons were sourced on [flaticon.com](https://www.flaticon.com/). Attribution is noted in the footer of the site.

## Reflections  
  I found this project to be helpful and really fun. The steps involved were to:  
  - read the spec thoroughly and make a plan.   
  - create a wireframe for the page structure.  
  - plan and source the creative elements (fonts, colors, images, icons, etc).  
  - write the HTML.  
  - write the CSS.  
  - refactor!

## Challenges  
  The most difficult part of this project was figuring out how to use the grid layout.

## Wins  
  I am most proud of the following:  
  - having an organized and thorough approach to completing this project.
  - the responsive design.
